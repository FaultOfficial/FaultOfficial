			<h1>Guards</h1>
			<p>Multiple guards are seen throughout the game. They are not important to the storyline, just an enemy that can be there for you to kill(or to kill you).</p><br />
			<h2>US Guard</h2>
			<p>The United States guard was first seen on mission 1 in the main security room. Of course, along with being the first enemies, they are the dumbest and the most weak. Yet when grouped together, US Guards can be nearly impossible to kill.</p>
			<div class="USGuard1"></div>
			<p>The US Guard is equipped with a Glock.</p><br />
			<h2>US Special Guard</h2>
			<p>The US special guard looks and acts much like the normal US guard, yet the model is slightly larger and has a much different pose. This guard is much more of a tank because of its high defence.</p>
			<div class="USGuard2"></div>
			<p>The US Special Guard carries a Marksman Tactical Rifle, which does slightly more damage than a Glock.</p><br />
			<h2>US Vehicle Specialist</h2>
			<p>The US Vehicle Speacialist, first seen on the third mission, acts like a normal US guard, exept he is usually found driving a vehicle(go figure!). His uniform includes brown engravings and an earpiece.</p>
			<div class="USGuard3"></div>
			<p>The US Vehicle Specialist is equipped with a Marksman Tactical Rifle and a Wrench.</p>
